AtliQ Grands Power BI Dashboard - Transformed datasets in Power Query, built 24 DAX KPIs for business goals, and designed stakeholder-aligned dashboard revealing market and customer insights.


* Data Preparation & Modeling: Imported multiple distinct datasets into Power BI, used Power Query Editor to clean and transform data (e.g., handling duplicates, data types, and calculations), then established relationships between tables (like fact-dimension joins) to create a scalable data model ready for analysis.

* KPI Development with DAX: Engineered 24 key metrics and KPIs using DAX formulas, including measures for revenue, occupancy rates, customer segmentation, and trends—ensuring alignment with AtliQ Grands' objectives like revenue optimization and market expansion through functions like CALCULATE, SUMX, and time intelligence.

* Dashboard Design & Insights: Designed a user-friendly dashboard matching stakeholder mock-ups with slicers, cards, charts (e.g., bar/line visuals for KPIs), and drill-throughs; proactively analyzed data to uncover insights like peak booking patterns and customer preferences beyond standard metrics.
